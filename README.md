[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubio/send_nsca.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubio/send_nsca)


Overview
----
NSCA is the remote passive acceptance daemon used with many Nagios installs. It
ships with a (C-language) executable called `send_nsca` for submitting checks.
This is a mostly-clean re-implementation of `send_nsca` in pure-python. It
supports 10 of the 26 crypto functions used by upstream NSCA, sending to
multiple hosts with one invocation, and timeouts.

Testing
-----
The unit/integration tests for this package are located in the `tests/`
directory.  Unit tests only require the unittest2 package (or python 2.7+)
and the mock library; integration tests also require the `nsca` binary. To
run them, simply make sure that your `$PYTHONPATH` is set up correctly and
run `nosetests -v tests`.

Installing
-----
This software uses setuptools/distutils; you can install it with `sudo python setup.py install`,
and it's easy to write packaging for your favorite OS.
